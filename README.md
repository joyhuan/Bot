# Bot

I came across this [Amazon Fresh Whole Foods Delivery Slot Finder bot](https://github.com/ahertel/Amazon-Fresh-Whole-Foods-delivery-slot-finder) on May 13. It reminds me of the impact of software engineer. Three years ago, I had a similar problem where I kept refreshing Student Center to enroll a class. Two of my classmates wrote a bot. Considering this task daunting, I simply asked them to subscribe my email without trying to write one. I told myself that some day I will do that. The day has come. Though I do feel mortified for my procrastination, I believe in Amor Fati. Many changes happeded in these three years and they are indispensable building blocks that lead to today. Now when I think it's too late, it's also the earliest time.
